## Getting Started
To run the application you will need to install or have [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools/installing-xcode-and-simulators) on your machine and clone the repo to run in a simulation. This project was made for the educational purpose 
of the program and does not have all functionality of buttons or actual notifications in place as these were outside of the scope required for this project.
